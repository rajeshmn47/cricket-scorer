# Ballbyball Contribution Guide

1. Avoid duplicate work, issues, PRs etc.
2. We encourage you to collaborate with fellow community members on some of our bigger issues!
   - We highly recommend to post your idea and discuss it.
3. Create a draft PR when starting work on bigger changes.
4. Clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR.
5. Don't submit stuff that's broken.
6. Avoid making unnecessary changes, especially if they're purely based on your personal
   preferences. Doing so is the maintainers' job. ;-)
